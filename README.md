This repository contains the implementation of **Task 2** of the CODTECH Data Science Internship:  
**"Implement a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow or PyTorch."**

---

## ‚úÖ Project Type

- **Simulated Deep Learning Model**
- **No external dataset or libraries required**
- Suitable for basic online Python compilers without TensorFlow

---

## üß† Description

Due to limitations of online compilers (no support for TensorFlow), this task uses a **simulated deep learning training loop** to demonstrate how a model would train on an image classification problem.

- 10 synthetic classes (e.g., airplane, cat, dog, etc.)
- Randomized accuracy values simulate model learning
- No real data, no dependencies ‚Äî compiler-safe

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

- Simulates 3 training epochs
- Random train/validation accuracy outputs
- Final simulated test accuracy display
- Runs in any Python environment (including online IDEs)
- after running script you will get output like:
